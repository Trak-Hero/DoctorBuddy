# Doctor Buddy

## Description
**Doctor Buddy** is an iOS application built on Swift that maintains and creates Progress Note forms for doctors to use. For further details on the introduction, development, and results, please [see the Paper on Doctor Buddy.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9dwUEsOgfZ8UtO791waEbm0O_BbTglYdqZ-3K-79ng/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Running
To run this program, download every file to your local computer. Open it in `XCode` and try compiling it. You may need to recreate the `NSManagedObject` again.

## Future Developments
Currently, the code runs on the `XCode Simulator`. In the near future, I hope to publish this application on iOS to test-run it.
